We grew up, built our own lives, had children, yet we always kept our bond alive through ink. After losing our spouses, our letters became a promise, and he crossed the ocean to be with me. The years by his side were the most beautiful of my life. Jonas is gone now, but his love still lives in every page of my story.",
